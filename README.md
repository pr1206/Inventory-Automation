# Inventory-Automation
This project was created using Google AppsScript to automatically send an email consisting of a table of inventory items that need to be reordered. The table consists of the Item Name, the OfficeMax Item Number, and the current quantity of the item. The result of this project reduced time spent on inventory management by 50% and ensured that office supplies could be ordered on time. This project was coded in JavaScript.
